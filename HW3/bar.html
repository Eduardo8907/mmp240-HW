            <p>You meet your friend at the bar and you two grab a drink. After a few drinks you are feeling nice and know you are still fine to make the meeting in the moring. This is when your friend decides its time for shots. You buy the first round but your friends wants another. The bartender hooks it up as a birthday gift. After some more drinks and some more shots you are feeling drunk. </p>
